Attack tree models are a well-known approach to hostile threat risk analysis.
Despite of its apparent relation to logical formula, its proof theoretical semantics have not yet 
been provided.

%
This paper describes a proof theoretial definitions of attack trees  by using linear logic.
%
% results & conclusion
%
We argue that linear logic and its phase space semantics is a simple, yet powerful tool to 
determin and evaluate the risk of attack scenarios.
