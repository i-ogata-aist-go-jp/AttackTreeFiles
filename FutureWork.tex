It should be better if we allow sharing of leaf nodes ( variables ). 
 For this, we have to introduce exponentials in linear logic.

The Lindenbaumâ€“Tarski algebra of a theory in classical propositional logic is a Boolean algebra.

Suppose $\Lambda$ is a normal modal logic, 
then its Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra has a natural BAO (Boolean Algebra with operators) structure.

A function $m : B \rightarrow B$ is said to be an {\it operator}
on the Boolean Algebra, if it preserves join, i.e., 
$m ( a \vee b) = m (a) \vee m (b)$. 
%
The operator is said to be {\it normal} if $m(\bot) = \bot$.
